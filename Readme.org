#+title: Emacs Vanilla Config

* Intro
Coming from Doom Emacs (config [[https://github.com/roy-corentin/my-Doom-emacs-config][here]]) I want to try an Emacs config from vanilla to improve performance and make customization easier.
Do not be surprise to see some similarities in keybinding with Doom.

To improve performance I want to try to use as maximum as possible only built-in packages. And the lighest package possible (see *Stack* section for more information)

I'm not a big fan of lazy loading, I prefer a slower startup but a faster application in use so there is not a lof of '=defer t=' in this config

* Stack
This is not an exhaustive list of package but only here to show important choices

- Lsp: =Eglot= /(built-in)/
- Workspace: =Tab-Bar mode= /(built-in)/
- Package Manager: =Elpaca=
- Keybindings:
  - Global: =General=
  - Motion: =Evil=
- Completion:
  - MiniBuffer: =Vetico= /(helm is too fat and slow)/
  - In Buffer: =Corfu= /(company is slow and fat too)/
  - Search Algo: =Orderless=
  - Backend: =Cape=
- Git: =Magit= /(of course)/
- Major Modes: =Tree-Sitter= /(when available, best perf)/

* Compilation
I use *Emacs 30.0.90* compiled with ~./configure --with-native-compilation --with-json --with-tree-sitter --with-pgtk --without-x --with-mailutils --with-imagemagick~
